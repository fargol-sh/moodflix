ðŸ“Œ About This Project

This repository contains a React + Tailwind CSS project powered by Appwrite as the backend database service. The application was built while following a tutorial from the JS Mastery YouTube channel, serving as a practical exercise to refresh and strengthen my React knowledge and general frontend development skills.

The project demonstrates:

Component-based development with React

Responsive and modern UI styling using Tailwind CSS

Backend integration and data management with Appwrite

âš¡ Note: This project was not authored from scratch, but rather implemented as a learning and review exercise to reinforce best practices in frontend development and explore Appwriteâ€™s database features in a real-world setup.
